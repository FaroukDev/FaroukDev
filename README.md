#### Unit testing with Pytest (python) and Mocha/Chai/Sinon (nodejs).

Switched to Typescript in order to improve our productivity. Adding types to all of our code (no "any" 🙂)

Worked on multiple projects collaboratively and learned advanced code versioning with git and Github: pull requests, rebasing, Github projects

CI/CD with Github Actions (and Azure Pipelines): run unit tests and deploy to different Azure services

Provision virtual machines on Azure thanks to Ansible playbooks (running in our CI/CD pipeline)

IaC with Terraform (and Azure Resource Manager)

Automate deployment of resources on Azure
```
```

Integration in CI/CD pipeline

"Docker everything"

Using Docker daily for my personal workflow and for many projects.

Push and pull to private registries (on Azure), docker networks, managing containers with Docker compose, ...

Container orchestration basics with Kubernetes

Networking basics: OSI, TCP/IP, routing, VPN, subnets, ...

Experienced different cloud architectures: microservices vs monolithic

Every project was deployed on Microsoft Azure. Through the training we got to use (or at least experiment) with many Azure services:

VM, App Services, Functions, Databases (Azure SQL, Postgres, Cosmos), Container registries, Container instances, Storage, Azure DevOps, Kubernetes, DNS, Load balancers, ...
```
```
Projects:
