### 6 months training in Cloud Development.

Learned programming and cloud development. Always keeping best practices in mind.

Training taught in French and English.

Preparing for AZ-900 and AZ-204 certifications



- Learned programming with python and javascript.

- Introduction to algorithms and data structures 

- Frontend basics with HTML/CSS and vanilla JS.

- Then moved to a more complex framework: Reactjs.

- API development with Flask (python) and Express (nodejs).

Always writing clean and testable code!

#### Unit testing with Pytest (python) and Mocha/Chai/Sinon (nodejs).

Switched to Typescript in order to improve our productivity. Adding types to all of our code (no "any" ðŸ™‚)

Worked on multiple projects collaboratively and learned advanced code versioning with git and Github: pull requests, rebasing, Github projects

CI/CD with Github Actions (and Azure Pipelines): run unit tests and deploy to different Azure services

Provision virtual machines on Azure thanks to Ansible playbooks (running in our CI/CD pipeline)

IaC with Terraform (and Azure Resource Manager)

Automate deployment of resources on Azure

Integration in CI/CD pipeline

"Docker everything"

Using Docker daily for my personal workflow and for many projects.

Push and pull to private registries (on Azure), docker networks, managing containers with Docker compose, ...

Container orchestration basics with Kubernetes

Networking basics: OSI, TCP/IP, routing, VPN, subnets, ...

Experienced different cloud architectures: microservices vs monolithic

Every project was deployed on Microsoft Azure. Through the training we got to use (or at least experiment) with many Azure services:

VM, App Services, Functions, Databases (Azure SQL, Postgres, Cosmos), Container registries, Container instances, Storage, Azure DevOps, Kubernetes, DNS, Load balancers, ...

Projects:

**Scraper**

**Bot discord**
